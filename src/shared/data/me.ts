    "I do my best at night when everything is quiet and I can really dive into coding. I'm convinced my productivity has a direct correlation with caffeine levels, so with Red Bull keeping me energized, I feel unstoppable. And it's all about finding that perfect workflow that lets me get things done faster and more effectively.",
