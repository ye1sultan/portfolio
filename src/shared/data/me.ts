  about:
    "I do my best work when it’s quiet and I can get in the zone — usually late at night, headphones on, Red Bull nearby, deep in code. I’m all about flow and efficiency: building fast, clean, and scalable systems without the fluff. I’m constantly refining my workflow to move quicker and ship smarter. Whether it’s diving into new tech or pushing a product over the finish line, I bring energy, focus, and a high bar for quality to everything I build.",
